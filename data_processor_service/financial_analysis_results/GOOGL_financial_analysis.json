      "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade | The Motley Fool",
      "content": "What's a key downside of investing in a game-changing technology with fast-paced advances? One that immediately comes to mind is that there's no way to know for sure which stocks will be the biggest winners.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a great case in point. Some of the top AI names right now might not be at the top 10 years from now. Does this mean that buy-and-hold investing is futile with AI stocks? Not at all. Here are three AI stocks I think you can safely buy and hold for the next decade.\n\nOnce upon a time, some pundits predicted that generative AI would present an existential threat to Alphabet 's ( GOOG +0.46% ) ( GOOGL +0.54% ) Google Search. You don't hear such dire warnings too much these days, though. Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Google Search continues to grow robustly.\n\nAlphabet defied the expectations of some doomsayers by evolving its search engine to incorporate generative AI, introducing new features such as AI Overviews and AI Mode. The company also released one of the top-ranked large language models (LLMs) on the market, Google Gemini, which has an even more powerful version on the way soon.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in July, \"AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum.\" He was right. His statement is especially true for Google Cloud. The unit's revenue soared 32% year over year in the second quarter of 2025, maintaining Google Cloud's position as the fastest-growing major cloud services provider.\n\nI suspect we've only seen the beginning of how Alphabet will make money through AI. The company's Waymo business is a leader in the up-and-coming robotaxi market. Its Android XR operating system sets the stage for Alphabet to be a strong contender in the AI glasses market as well. I believe this company will be significantly larger 10 years from now, with AI serving as one of its biggest growth drivers.\n\nAmazon ( AMZN +1.41% ) recently made headlines with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage that impacted many well-known businesses. I doubt many people will remember this public relations black eye a decade from now. Furthermore, I predict that AWS will rake in a lot more revenue than it does today.\n\nIs AWS growing more slowly than its top rivals, such as Google Cloud? Yes. However, its revenue still jumped 17.5% year over year in Q2. And AWS continues to launch new capabilities, including agentic AI products, that should continue to attract new customers.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is leveraging AI effectively to increase its overall profitability. For example, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model that controls over 1 million robots and is improving their travel efficiency. It's also using AI-powered demand forecasting to boost accuracy, optimize inventory placement, and reduce delivery times for millions of items purchased on its e-commerce platform.\n\nAmazon is preparing to soon provide satellite internet service to customers using its Project Kuiper satellite network. I have no doubt the company will move into additional new markets over the next 10 years, some AI-related and others not.\n\nMicrosoft ( MSFT +0.00% ) might have made the smartest deal in the age of AI so far with its partnership with OpenAI. As a result, the company has been able to integrate generative AI throughout its software products, making them more valuable than ever to users.\n\nAI has also provided a huge tailwind for Microsoft Azure, which ranks as the second-largest cloud services provider after AWS. Business is booming for Azure, with Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment revenue jumping 27% year over year in its latest quarter.\n\nCould Microsoft's momentum wane? Maybe, but I doubt it will. CEO Satya Nadella noted in the company's recent quarterly update, \"Cloud and AI is [sic] the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector.\" The transformation he referred to is still in its early innings, in my view.\n\nI think Microsoft's productivity products are ideal for agentic AI to show its value. I'm also glad to see the company expand its umbrella by offering Anthropic's Claude AI models as well as OpenAI's models in Microsoft 365 Copilot. This company, like Alphabet and Amazon, has staying power.",

      "content": "Stock futures are little changed Thursday night ahead of a key inflation print.\n\nFutures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 18 points, or 0.04%. S&P futures ticked up 0.06%, while Nasdaq 100 futures added almost 0.2%.\n\nIn after-hours trading, Intel shares popped 7% after the chipmaker reported third-quarter sales that exceeded analysts' estimates . Target shares rose marginally after the retailer announced it would slash its corporate workforce by 8%, marking its first major layoff in a decade. Applied Materials and Rivian also announced layoffs.\n\nThe three major U.S. indexes ended the previous session higher, driven by inflows into tech stocks and bullish sentiment heading into the heat of third-quarter earnings season. The S&P 500 rose nearly 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 144 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed, closing the day 0.9% higher as heavyweight AI stocks such as Nvidia and Oracle got a boost.\n\nInvestors are awaiting Friday's release of the September consumer price index report, which could be a market-moving event given the lack of federal data being released amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Wall Street will be watching for any signs of inflation cooling or getting hotter, and if tariffs are affecting consumer prices.\n\nThe CPI, which was supposed to be released Oct. 15, will be the last economic reading before the Federal Reserve's October meeting next week. Markets widely expect the Fed to lower interest rates by another quarter percentage point.\n\n\"Markets remain cautious, as the lack of clean economic data adds uncertainty for both the Fed and investors,\" said Vishal Khanduja, head of broad markets fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"Until more reliable data emerges, the Fed is likely to adhere to market-priced expectations, though Friday's CPI should provide greater clarity. The impact of tariffs creeping into inflation will be key.\"\n\nStocks are on pace to notch weekly gains, after Thursday's moves erased Wednesday's losses. The S&P 500 is tracking for a 1.1% gain, while the Nasdaq and the 30-stock Dow are up nearly 1.2% week to date.\n\nAI company Anthropic and Google officially announced their cloud partnership Thursday in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe deal, which marks Google's largest TPU commitment to date, gives Anthropic access to up to one million of Google's custom-designed Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, and is expected to bring well over a gigawatt of AI compute capacity online in 2026. The partnership will add over a gigawatt of compute capacity by 2026, supporting Anthropic's surging $7 billion revenue run rate.\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet were about 0.7% higher in extended trading. More on the deal here .\n\nCheck out the companies making headlines in after-hours trading:\n\nShortly after 6 p.m. ET on Thursday, futures tied to the S&P 500 gained about 0.05% and Nasdaq-100 futures added nearly 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 15 points, or less than 0.1%.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
