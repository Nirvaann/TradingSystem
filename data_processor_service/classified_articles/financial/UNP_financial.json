    "content": "Union Pacific was firing on all cylinders during the third quarter, as pricing gains, record workforce productivity and fuel consumption led to higher profits despite flat volume.\n\n“We are focused on driving continued improvements in our pursuit of what’s possible … [C]ore pricing gains and continued operational efficiencies drove the strong financial results in the quarter,” Chief Executive Jim Vena said on the railroad’s Thursday morning earnings call. “Freight revenue, excluding fuel, grew for the sixth consecutive quarter and set a best-ever record. In addition, we set best-ever quarterly records in workforce productivity, fuel consumption, terminal dwell, and train length.”\n\nOperating income at Omaha-based UP (NYSE: UNP ) increased 6%, to $2.5 billion, as revenue grew 3%, to $6.2 billion. Earnings per share increased 9%, to $3.01.\n\nThe quarterly operating ratio improved 1.1 points to 59.2% as expenses increased 1%. Adjusted for costs related to the proposed acquisition of Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ), the operating ratio was 58.5%.\n\nNorfolk Southern will report earnings Thursday after the close of markets. The companies are expected to submit their detailed merger application with the Surface Transportation Board after Oct. 29.\n\nVolume was flat when measured by carloads and intermodal units, but up 5% based on revenue ton-miles.\n\nBulk carloads increased 7%, largely on a spike in coal traffic. Industrial products volume rose 3% as industrial chemicals and plastic traffic increased 8%. Premium volume – which includes intermodal and automotive traffic – declined 5%, led by an identical drop in intermodal volume. The intermodal decline, UP said, was largely due to unfavorable comparisons to last year’s unprecedented surge in international intermodal traffic.\n\nKey operational metrics all improved for the quarter: Freight car velocity was up 8%, train speed increased 4%, and terminal dwell declined 9% to an all-time low of 20.4 hours. Average train length grew 2% to 9,801 feet, a quarterly record.\n\n“Our results do an excellent job demonstrating the team’s unwavering focus on our strategy to lead the industry in safety, service, and operational excellence,” said Eric Gehringer, executive vice president of operations. “Our vision is clear and fundamentally the railroad is operating exceptionally well, showcasing robust fluidity, consistency, and reliability.”\n\nExecutives noted that the operational improvements came amid the highest volume quarter of the year.\n\nEmployment levels dropped 4% compared to a year ago, to 28,871.\n\nIn a note to employees, Vena said the personal injury and train accident rates improved to the point that UP was on pace to reach its goal of becoming the safest Class I railroad in the U.S.\n\nThe chemicals industry hates the UP – NS merger\n\nFreight locomotive sales power Wabtec earnings\n\nJust two U.S. makers of critical railroad material left after plant closure\n\nCN announces changes to senior management",

    "content": "Norfolk Southern Corp. reported third quarter income of $1.1 billion on revenue that was 2% higher at $3.1 billion despite flat freight volumes.\n\nDiluted earnings per share was $3.16, down from the prior year and short of Wall Street’s forecast range of $3.18 to $3.22.\n\nThe earnings for the Atlanta-based carrier (NYSE: NSC ) came after the close of markets and on the same day proposed merger partner Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ) reported its earnings.\n\nIncome from railway operations was lower than the previous year’s figure of $1.6 billion (that had included significant railway line sales benefits), and showed a meaningful adjusted increase when excluding merger-related expenses and other charges. On an adjusted basis, the income showed an uptick of $21 million to $1.1 billion, fueled primarily by incremental land sales amounting to $65 million.\n\nThe operating ratio, a critical measure of efficiency, was 64.6% and a significant increase from the 47.7% recorded in the third quarter of 2024. When adjusting for extraordinary items, the current operating ratio presented a slight improvement to 63.3%, comparing favorably to the adjusted 63.4% from the previous year.\n\nExcluding merger-related and other extraordinary charges, diluted earnings per share slightly increased to $3.30, up by 2% from the adjusted result for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n“Norfolk Southern delivered another quarter of strong results on safety, service, and productivity through a dynamic freight market,” said President and Chief Executive Mark George, in a release. “The entire Thoroughbred team pulled together to serve our customers, achieve an all-time record in fuel efficiency, delivered on key productivity initiatives, and executed a noteworthy land sale that will ultimately deliver rail volumes for years to come. I’m proud of the way our team is performing with discipline and focus — driving results and strengthening our foundation for long term success.”\n\nFind more articles by Stuart Chirls here .\n\nUnion Pacific profits rise on operational efficiency, pricing gains\n\nFirst look: Union Pacific Q3 earnings\n\nFreight locomotive sales power Wabtec earnings\n\nJust two U.S. makers of critical railroad material left after plant closure",
