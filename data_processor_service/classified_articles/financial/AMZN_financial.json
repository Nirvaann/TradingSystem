The move is a continuation of the merchant’s more recent plans for international expansion for that business arm.\n\nIn March 2021, Walmart stopped requiring its marketplace sellers to be registered in the U.S. and opened up its platform to foreign retailers . Chinese manufacturers were a large part of the subsequent surge in outside sellers offering products on Walmart.com. The company also actively began recruiting U.K. sellers for its U.S. site in June.\n\nWalmart has been in the Canadian market for decades and even operates a local marketplace through Walmart.ca, which the merchant says is “thriving.” But giving Canadian retailers the opportunity to access Walmart U.S.’s more than XX million monthly online shoppers will allow them to expand their cross-border operations by scaling stateside.\n\nThe push “comes as local (Canadian) businesses — especially small- and medium-sized enterprises — are looking to reap the benefits of the Canada-United States-Mexico free trade agreement,” or CUSMA, according to a press release issued by the merchant. Walmart is focused on growing its marketplaces and “investing heavily” in new tools and services for sellers, says Darren Carithers , senior vice president of marketplace development for Walmart International.\n\nWalmart is No. X in the 2022 listing of Digital Commerce 360’s Top 100 Global Online Marketplaces and No. X in the Top 1000 , a ranking of the top online retailers in North America.\n\nHere’s a look at how Walmart Marketplace stacks up against competitors in terms of number of sellers and product inventory and a recap of consumers’ experiences and shopping behavior on marketplaces.\n\nMore sellers means more products. And a large part of the allure of marketplaces is the quantity and breadth of items that are available. Nearly a quarter — XX% — of consumers say the broader assortment of goods on these platforms is appealing, according to a Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights survey of 1,000 online shoppers in May. And a quarter — XX% — of respondents say a bigger selection of products in a merchandise category they’re browsing makes them more likely to purchase from a marketplace versus a traditional retailer’s ecommerce site.\n\nSo it’s no wonder that marketplace operators — especially mass merchant platforms with a variety of categories — court outside sellers and often use number of sellers as an indicator of the growth and overall health of their platform. In mid-August, during a call with investors discussing Q2 results, Walmart executives touted the company’s expanding third-party seller pool. The number of outside merchants listing on Walmart.com jumped about 60% year over year, said John David Rainey , executive vice president and chief financial officer.\n\nMarketplace Pulse, a research firm that tracks data on online shopping mall platforms, estimates nearly XX third-party sellers currently have product listings on Walmart Marketplace, which launched in August 2009. That number is nearly 12 times higher than the roughly XX sellers on the platform just five years ago in September 2017.\n\nWhile the swell in Walmart Marketplace’s third-party merchants is notable, the total is still a far cry from the seller base of many other top online marketplaces. EBay Inc. (No. X in the Top 100 marketplace rankings) leads the pack with XX million sellers. Amazon.com Inc. , Walmart’s main competitor, has XX million sellers. The web behemoth is No. X in the Top 100 marketplace rankings and No. X in the Top 1000. Walmart ranks 19th when it comes to number of sellers among the Top 100 marketplaces, where the median is XX.\n\nIn the Q2 earnings call, Rainey said Walmart has grown to more than 240 million products in its U.S. ecommerce assortment. The platform falls in third place among top U.S. marketplaces, with eBay coming in first with XX billion current listings. That’s nearly seven times the products on Walmart.com. And Amazon registers XX million. The median number of products sold on Top 100 marketplaces is XX million, so Walmart has a huge lead over most other ranked platforms.\n\nConsumers notice the strides marketplaces are making in expanding product assortment. A third — XX% — of online shoppers reported seeing more items available on marketplaces relative to the prior year, according to the Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights survey from May.\n\nAmazon still reigns supreme among U.S. marketplaces. Seven in 10, or XX% online shoppers reported making a purchase from an Amazon marketplace seller in the last year, according to the Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights survey from May. That’s compared to XX% of consumers buying from an eBay seller and XX% from a third party on Walmart Marketplace.\n\nThat popularity among online shoppers is reflected in sales figures. In 2021, Amazon raked in a Digital Commerce 360-estimated $XX billion in total gross merchandise value, or GMV, which reflects the sale of physical goods through both first-party inventory and third-party marketplace sellers. That’s five and a half times the GMV of Walmart, which was $XX billion last year, Digital Commerce 360 estimates.\n\nThe disparity grows when considering GMV from purchases through third-party sellers. Amazon pulls more than double the GMV share from outside merchants — XX% to Walmart’s XX% in 2021. That translated into $XX billion in third-party gross sales in 2021 for Amazon — more than 13 times Walmart’s $XX billion.\n\nAmazon is also the favorite platform among Top 1000 retailers selling on marketplaces. More than half — XX% — of ranked merchants offer their products on Amazon. That’s nearly four and a half times the share of Top 1000 retailers selling on Walmart Marketplace at XX%. EBay’s share of Top 1000 marketplace sellers — XX% — edges out Walmart but is still far off from Amazon.\n\nThe gap between Amazon and Walmart adoption rates widen when considering merchant type. Amazon is far and away the preferred marketplace for consumer brand manufacturers with XX% of Top 1000 brands listing there. Just XX% of brands sell on Walmart Marketplace.\n\nSign in or purchase a Digital Commerce 360 Research Membership to unlock this content and much more!\n\nCopyright © 2025 Digital Commerce 360 | Vertical Web Media LLC\n\nCopyright © 2025 Digital Commerce 360 | Vertical Web Media LLC",

    "content": "An integration powered by Amazon Ads’ retail media data is meant to drive “more measurable business outcomes” for E.l.f. on the platform.\n\nE.l.f. Cosmetics wants to inject more performance into its Twitch advertising with the new in-stream shoppable integration. The capability is powered by Amazon Ads, allowing E.l.f. to draw on the e-commerce giant’s troves of retail media data to better target and measure campaigns. The timing aligns with the gear up to the holiday season, a critical sales window for retail brands.\n\n“Twitch is where communities and creators connect through authentic, live engagement — and now, through shoppable moments,” said Sarah Iooss, head of U.S. agency at Amazon Ads, in a press statement. “We’re thrilled to partner with e.l.f. to test this innovative new format that keeps viewers immersed in the content they love while discovering and purchasing products in real time.”\n\nE.l.f. sees the ad format as a way to drive “more measurable business outcomes” from its creator content without putting off viewers through disruptive messages, per the release. The brand launched on Twitch in 2020 to better connect with subcultures like gaming and empower women creators in the space. E.l.f.You! has accrued over 43.3 million cumulative minutes watched and nearly 24,000 followers .\n\nThe news builds on a run of experiments where Amazon has tried to tie livestreaming and commerce closer together, a strategy that has not always panned out despite the company’s considerable scale and sophistication in retail media advertising. Amazon does not publicly share Twitch’s ad revenue, but some streamers claim their earnings from the site have plunged and the platform’s struggles to turn a profit have been well documented .\n\nSocial and livestreaming-enabled commerce broadly have seen sluggish adoption in the U.S., though that’s not for lack of platforms trying to make the idea popular. TikTok, a Twitch rival, is also making commerce a bigger part of its growth agenda through TikTok Shop, an offering that has started to see more traction with consumers.",

    "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade | The Motley Fool",
    "content": "What's a key downside of investing in a game-changing technology with fast-paced advances? One that immediately comes to mind is that there's no way to know for sure which stocks will be the biggest winners.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a great case in point. Some of the top AI names right now might not be at the top 10 years from now. Does this mean that buy-and-hold investing is futile with AI stocks? Not at all. Here are three AI stocks I think you can safely buy and hold for the next decade.\n\nOnce upon a time, some pundits predicted that generative AI would present an existential threat to Alphabet 's ( GOOG +0.46% ) ( GOOGL +0.54% ) Google Search. You don't hear such dire warnings too much these days, though. Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Google Search continues to grow robustly.\n\nAlphabet defied the expectations of some doomsayers by evolving its search engine to incorporate generative AI, introducing new features such as AI Overviews and AI Mode. The company also released one of the top-ranked large language models (LLMs) on the market, Google Gemini, which has an even more powerful version on the way soon.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in July, \"AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum.\" He was right. His statement is especially true for Google Cloud. The unit's revenue soared 32% year over year in the second quarter of 2025, maintaining Google Cloud's position as the fastest-growing major cloud services provider.\n\nI suspect we've only seen the beginning of how Alphabet will make money through AI. The company's Waymo business is a leader in the up-and-coming robotaxi market. Its Android XR operating system sets the stage for Alphabet to be a strong contender in the AI glasses market as well. I believe this company will be significantly larger 10 years from now, with AI serving as one of its biggest growth drivers.\n\nAmazon ( AMZN +1.41% ) recently made headlines with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage that impacted many well-known businesses. I doubt many people will remember this public relations black eye a decade from now. Furthermore, I predict that AWS will rake in a lot more revenue than it does today.\n\nIs AWS growing more slowly than its top rivals, such as Google Cloud? Yes. However, its revenue still jumped 17.5% year over year in Q2. And AWS continues to launch new capabilities, including agentic AI products, that should continue to attract new customers.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is leveraging AI effectively to increase its overall profitability. For example, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model that controls over 1 million robots and is improving their travel efficiency. It's also using AI-powered demand forecasting to boost accuracy, optimize inventory placement, and reduce delivery times for millions of items purchased on its e-commerce platform.\n\nAmazon is preparing to soon provide satellite internet service to customers using its Project Kuiper satellite network. I have no doubt the company will move into additional new markets over the next 10 years, some AI-related and others not.\n\nMicrosoft ( MSFT +0.00% ) might have made the smartest deal in the age of AI so far with its partnership with OpenAI. As a result, the company has been able to integrate generative AI throughout its software products, making them more valuable than ever to users.\n\nAI has also provided a huge tailwind for Microsoft Azure, which ranks as the second-largest cloud services provider after AWS. Business is booming for Azure, with Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment revenue jumping 27% year over year in its latest quarter.\n\nCould Microsoft's momentum wane? Maybe, but I doubt it will. CEO Satya Nadella noted in the company's recent quarterly update, \"Cloud and AI is [sic] the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector.\" The transformation he referred to is still in its early innings, in my view.\n\nI think Microsoft's productivity products are ideal for agentic AI to show its value. I'm also glad to see the company expand its umbrella by offering Anthropic's Claude AI models as well as OpenAI's models in Microsoft 365 Copilot. This company, like Alphabet and Amazon, has staying power.",

In fiscal year 2023, the agency received $665 million in revenue from 132 million returned parcels.\n\n\"Considering the significant growth of the reverse logistics business, there may be additional opportunities for USPS to grow its share of the reverse logistics marketplace and increase its revenues from this line of business,\" the report said.\n\nFor Amazon, the additional returns option comes as it gears up for the peak shipping season and the expected post-holiday wave of returns. Retailers forecast 17% of 2025 holiday sales will be returned , a notch above the projected 15.8% in overall annual sales to be returned this year, per a report from the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns.\n\nAmazon still has a variety of returns options for customers beyond USPS pickup, including drop-off returns options at Staples, Whole Foods and The UPS Store locations.\n\n\"Four out of five Amazon customers in the U.S. have access to at least one of our 8,000-plus drop-off locations, with a label-free, shipping box-free return option available within 5 miles of their home,\" the Amazon spokesperson said.",

    "title": "AI lifts leaders in September Ecommerce Stock Index results",
    "content": "New results are in from September 2025 activity in the Baird/Digital Commerce 360 Ecommerce Stock Index. Throughout the month, artificial intelligence (AI) and partnership announcements drove movement — both positive and negative — as Alibaba and Etsy helped lead overall gains in the fifth consecutive month of growth.\n\nShare prices benefited from investor interest in AI spending, as well as Etsy’s presence in ChatGPT’s new ecommerce checkout experience.\n\nThis index is a collaboration between Digital Commerce 360 and the financial advisory, capital markets, asset management and private equity firm Baird . It intends to provide perspective into how public markets value companies and technology providers that power digital commerce. The index contains four categories capturing activity extending throughout the Americas and China:\n\nReaders should note that this index complements insights from Digital Commerce 360’s Top 2000 Database . That database specifically tracks North American online retailers and their web sales. The Baird/Digital Commerce 360 Ecommerce Stock Index, meanwhile, covers both B2C retail and B2B ecommerce companies, in addition to the technology vendors that serve them, with a broader focus on global activity. All commentary and reporting is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended to be financial advice.\n\nClick here to read July’s ecommerce stock index results.\n\n“The Baird/Digital Commerce Ecommerce Stock Index increased 4.2% in September compared to the end of August — the fifth consecutive month for positive returns, with diminishing concerns among investors around the impact of tariffs on ecommerce, healthy consumer spending trends in the U.S., and increasing excitement over AI and agentic commerce ,” said Colin Sebastian, Baird’s managing director and senior research analyst covering internet/ecommerce.\n\nSeptember results were enough to keep year-to-date growth for ecommerce stocks tracked by the index higher than growth for the S&P 5000 over the same period of time.\n\n“For the year to date, the Ecommerce Stock Index is now up 16.5%, tracking ahead of the broader S&P index (+13.7% YTD),” Sebastian said. “However, September performance varied by subsector, with particular strength evident among International platforms (+12%) and Ecommerce Technology (+5%), while Online Marketplaces (+2%) and Online Retail (flat) underperformed.”\n\nAs AI news powered optimism among investors, that positive sentiment extended beyond the U.S. to China-based Alibaba and the Israel-based ecommerce site platform Wix.\n\n“At this point, we continue to expect approximately 6% year-over-year ecommerce growth in the U.S. for 2025, although that includes some deceleration in growth during Q4,” Sebastian noted.\n\nAmong the index’s top overall stock performers in September, Alibaba led with its share price up 32% at the end of the month. That movement happened “as the company’s ecommerce and cloud businesses appear to be improving,” Sebastian said.\n\nAlibaba Cloud, which is the cloud computing and artificial intelligence arm of Alibaba Group, announced in September that it would commit more than $50 billion to AI development, as well as related infrastructure. Specifically, it outlined plans to open new data centers in Brazil, France and the Netherlands.\n\nAlibaba owns the world’s two largest online marketplaces by gross merchandise value (GMV), Taobao and Tmall. Taobao ranks No. 1 in the Global Online Marketplaces Database . That database contains Digital Commerce 360’s ranking of the largest such marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise volume (GMV). Tmall ranks No. 2.\n\nWix shares were up 26% at September’s end, which Sebastian attributed to “momentum in AI tools.”\n\nMeanwhile, Etsy, whose shares were up 25% at the end of September, also made headlines with AI announcements. The online marketplace is among the first participants to be using OpenAI’s new ChatGPT checkout experience . As a result, Etsy sellers will gain access to shoppers on OpenAI’s platform using the company’s new Agentic Commerce Protocol.\n\nEtsy ranks No. 20 in the Global Online Marketplaces Database .\n\nDespite overall growth, gains across the index were not evenly distributed.\n\n“Conversely, 1-800-Flowers (-18%), Klaviyo (-15%) and Instacart (-15%) were laggards in September, with Instacart in focus as online grocery competitors made several competitive announcements,” Sebastian said.\n\nAmong Instacart’s competitors, Uber Eats announced the addition of DSW to its platform. Since June, Uber Eats has also brought on Best Buy, Dollar Tree , Sephora , Aldi and Dick’s Sporting Goods .\n\nIn addition, the delivery platform DoorDash announced Ace Hardware as a new same-day delivery partner. That news preceded DoorDash’s addition of Kroger stores and the debut of DoorDash’s new DashMart Fulfillment Services and Dot robot .\n\nFinally, as all of these delivery apps continued to chase new retailers, Amazon’s same-day grocery delivery capabilities expanded to add more than 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. Together with onboarding new third-party grocery partners, that move made Amazon a more serious competitor to Instacart and Walmart Plus in the grocery space heading into the final months of 2025.\n\nSubmit your data and we’ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.",

    "title": "Amazon Prime Day 2025 draws holiday-like US ecommerce sales",
    "content": "Amazon Prime Day 2025 set “a new benchmark for summer ecommerce” sales, according to Adobe Analytics data about the full four-day event.\n\nAdobe Analytics had projected that Amazon’s summer Prime Day event in 2025 would generate $23.8 billion in overall ecommerce sales. Then, it found that the first day of the event had generated more online sales in the United States than any other day in 2025 to date.\n\nThroughout the entire four-day period, U.S. consumers made more than half of their purchases from mobile devices (53.2%), according to Adobe Analytics. It found that competitive discounts across U.S. retailers “drove price-sensitive shoppers to spend in categories such as appliances, where online sales were up 112% (compared to average daily sales in June 2025).” Other categories with strong growth, it said, included:\n\nAnd while U.S. consumers sought discounts, they still used buy now, pay later (BNPL) on 8.1% of orders, based on Adobe data. That’s up from 7.4% in 2024 and amounted to $2 billion over those four days. That represents 33.3% year-over-year growth.\n\nPrime Day 2024 drives record sales for overall US ecommerce\n\nAlthough Amazon did not attach a dollar amount to Prime Day 2025 sales, it said the event was its biggest ever.\n\n“This year’s Prime Day event was bigger than any previous four-day period that included a Prime Day event, with record sales and more items sold during the four days,” Amazon said in a statement.\n\nIt claims Prime members “saved billions while shopping Amazon’s millions of deals” during the event. Additionally, it said Prime members purchased “millions of Alexa-enabled devices, and the Ring Battery Doorbell and Fire TV Stick HD were two of the event’s best-selling items.”\n\nAmazon also claims independent sellers — it says most of them are small and medium-sized businesses — “achieved record sales and a record number of items sold.”\n\nAmazon ranks No. 1 in the Top 2000 , Digital Commerce 360’s database of North America’s largest online retailers based on web sales. It’s also No. 3 in the Global Online Marketplaces database , which ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise value (GMV). Digital Commerce 360 projects Amazon’s total web sales in 2024 will reach $469.01 billion.\n\nWhile Adobe Analytics data doesn’t specify how much Amazon itself generated in Prime Day 2025 sales, it gives insights into how the event impacted U.S. ecommerce sales overall.\n\nAmazon continues to speed up fulfillment in Q2 as sales grow\n\nAdobe Analytics data indicates that Amazon Prime Day 2025 led U.S. consumers to spend $24.1 billion online from July 8 to July 11. That’s $300 million more than Adobe had projected going into the event, as well as the equivalent of combining Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales in 2024 ($10.8 billion and $13.3 billion, respectively).\n\nOf the $24.1 billion, $12.8 billion came from mobile devices, Adobe said.\n\nAdobe Analytics data is based on more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million SKUs and 18 product categories, according to the company. More than 200 online retailers in the Top 2000 use Adobe Analytics for their web analytics, and more than 100 use it for site design and development. Top 2000 online retailers also use it for content delivery and management, as an ecommerce platform, a marketing platform, for personalization and more.\n\nAdobe also said consumers embraced generative AI during Amazon Prime Day 2025. They used generative AI chat services and browsers for shopping assistance. Adobe added that generative AI traffic to U.S. retail sites, which it measured by shoppers clicking on a link, increased 3,300% year over year.\n\n“And while AI-driven traffic remains modest compared to other channels (paid search, email), the growth shows the impact of AI on shoppers looking for deals or specific product details,” Adobe said.\n\nOnline holiday sales in 2024 'most mobile of all time'\n\n“Hot sellers” during the Prime Day event, Adobe said, included products such as:\n\nThose hot sellers benefited from strong discounts in particular categories. Apparel peaked at 24% off listed price, which compares to 20% in 2024. Meanwhile, Adobe also noted high discounts in:\n\n37% of consumers spent up to $20, on average, on their Amazon orders, Numerator data showed. Meanwhile, 29% spent at least $100, on average.\n\n46% of households spent an average of at least $200 during Prime Day, according to Numerator data. And while more than a third of households (37%) placed one order, more than a fifth placed two (23%). 14% placed three orders, and 9% placed four. Nearly a fifth (18%) placed five orders during the period.\n\nBased on the number of units consumers purchased, Numerator found that the top-selling items on Amazon during Prime Day 2025 were:\n\nIt also found that two-thirds (67%) of items sold for less than $20, while 3% were more than $100. The average spend per item, Numerator said, was $24.59.\n\nBy category, Numerator said, consumers spent most on:\n\nSubmit your data and we’ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.",
