But Thursday was all about meeting expectations in the present day.\n\nOn that, the company delivered, at least when it came to third-quarter results. Intel posted $13.7 billion in revenue, above the $13.2 billion that analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting and up 3% from a year before.\n\nBritney Nguyen is a tech reporter covering Nvidia, chips and AI.

      "title": "Stock futures are little changed ahead of highly awaited inflation data: Live updates",
      "content": "Stock futures are little changed Thursday night ahead of a key inflation print.\n\nFutures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 18 points, or 0.04%. S&P futures ticked up 0.06%, while Nasdaq 100 futures added almost 0.2%.\n\nIn after-hours trading, Intel shares popped 7% after the chipmaker reported third-quarter sales that exceeded analysts' estimates . Target shares rose marginally after the retailer announced it would slash its corporate workforce by 8%, marking\u00a0its first major layoff in a decade. Applied Materials and Rivian also announced layoffs.\n\nThe three major U.S. indexes ended the previous session higher, driven by inflows into tech stocks and bullish sentiment heading into the heat of third-quarter earnings season. The S&P 500 rose nearly 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 144 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed, closing the day 0.9% higher as heavyweight AI stocks such as Nvidia and Oracle got a boost.\n\nInvestors are awaiting Friday's release of the September consumer price index report, which could be a market-moving event given the lack of federal data being released amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Wall Street will be watching for any signs of inflation cooling or getting hotter, and if tariffs are affecting consumer prices.\n\nThe CPI, which was supposed to be released Oct. 15, will be the last economic reading before the Federal Reserve's October meeting next week. Markets widely expect the Fed to lower interest rates by another quarter percentage point.\n\n\"Markets remain cautious, as the lack of clean economic data adds uncertainty for both the Fed and investors,\" said\u00a0Vishal Khanduja, head of broad markets fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"Until more reliable data emerges, the Fed is likely to adhere to market-priced expectations, though Friday's CPI should provide greater clarity. The impact of tariffs creeping into inflation will be key.\"\n\nStocks are on pace to notch weekly gains, after Thursday's moves erased Wednesday's losses. The S&P 500 is tracking for a 1.1% gain, while the Nasdaq and the 30-stock Dow are up nearly 1.2% week to date.\n\nAI company Anthropic\u00a0and Google officially announced their cloud partnership Thursday in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe deal, which marks Google's largest TPU commitment to date, gives Anthropic access to up to one million of Google's custom-designed Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, and is expected to bring well over a gigawatt of AI compute capacity online in 2026. The partnership will add over a gigawatt of compute capacity by 2026, supporting Anthropic's surging $7 billion revenue run rate.\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet were about 0.7% higher in extended trading. More on the deal here .\n\nCheck out the companies making headlines in after-hours trading:\n\nShortly after 6 p.m. ET on Thursday, futures tied to the\u00a0S&P 500 gained about 0.05% and Nasdaq-100 futures added nearly 0.1%. Futures tied to the\u00a0Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 15 points, or less than 0.1%.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
