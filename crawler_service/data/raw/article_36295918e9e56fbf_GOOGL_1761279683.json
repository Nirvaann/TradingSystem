  "content": "YouTube has paid more than $8 billion to the music industry in the 12 months between July 2024 and July 2025, the company announced on Thursday.\n\nCohen first announced the milestone during a talk at Billboard Latin Music Week on Wednesday.\n\nThe milestone marks a new record for the platform, as YouTube’s annual music industry payout increased by $2 billion since 2022, when the company reported contributing $6 billion in revenue to the music industry between July 2021 and June 2022. A year before that, in 2021, YouTube announced that it had paid out $4 billion to the industry in 12 months.\n\nThursday’s announcement comes as Spotify announced earlier this year that it paid out $10 billion to the music industry in 2024. The company delivered $9 billion in 2023. It’s worth noting that the artists themselves don’t receive all the money — it also goes to labels, publishers, songwriters, and others.\n\n“As the platform’s global footprint continues to expand, so does the potential for artists and songwriters to build long-lasting music careers and forever fans on YouTube,” the company wrote in a blog post .\n\nYouTube is available in more than 100 countries and supports 80 languages.\n\nThe company announced last month at its Made on YouTube event that it paid more than $100 billion to creators, artists, and media companies in the last four years.",
