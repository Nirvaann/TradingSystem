  "content": "Amazon Prime Day 2025 set “a new benchmark for summer ecommerce” sales, according to Adobe Analytics data about the full four-day event.\n\nAdobe Analytics had projected that Amazon’s summer Prime Day event in 2025 would generate $23.8 billion in overall ecommerce sales. Then, it found that the first day of the event had generated more online sales in the United States than any other day in 2025 to date.\n\nThroughout the entire four-day period, U.S. consumers made more than half of their purchases from mobile devices (53.2%), according to Adobe Analytics. It found that competitive discounts across U.S. retailers “drove price-sensitive shoppers to spend in categories such as appliances, where online sales were up 112% (compared to average daily sales in June 2025).” Other categories with strong growth, it said, included:\n\nAnd while U.S. consumers sought discounts, they still used buy now, pay later (BNPL) on 8.1% of orders, based on Adobe data. That’s up from 7.4% in 2024 and amounted to $2 billion over those four days. That represents 33.3% year-over-year growth.\n\nPrime Day 2024 drives record sales for overall US ecommerce\n\nAlthough Amazon did not attach a dollar amount to Prime Day 2025 sales, it said the event was its biggest ever.\n\n“This year’s Prime Day event was bigger than any previous four-day period that included a Prime Day event, with record sales and more items sold during the four days,” Amazon said in a statement.\n\nIt claims Prime members “saved billions while shopping Amazon’s millions of deals” during the event. Additionally, it said Prime members purchased “millions of Alexa-enabled devices, and the Ring Battery Doorbell and Fire TV Stick HD were two of the event’s best-selling items.”\n\nAmazon also claims independent sellers — it says most of them are small and medium-sized businesses — “achieved record sales and a record number of items sold.”\n\nAmazon ranks No. 1 in the Top 2000 , Digital Commerce 360’s database of North America’s largest online retailers based on web sales. It’s also No. 3 in the Global Online Marketplaces database , which ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise value (GMV). Digital Commerce 360 projects Amazon’s total web sales in 2024 will reach $469.01 billion.\n\nWhile Adobe Analytics data doesn’t specify how much Amazon itself generated in Prime Day 2025 sales, it gives insights into how the event impacted U.S. ecommerce sales overall.\n\nAmazon continues to speed up fulfillment in Q2 as sales grow\n\nAdobe Analytics data indicates that Amazon Prime Day 2025 led U.S. consumers to spend $24.1 billion online from July 8 to July 11. That’s $300 million more than Adobe had projected going into the event, as well as the equivalent of combining Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales in 2024 ($10.8 billion and $13.3 billion, respectively).\n\nOf the $24.1 billion, $12.8 billion came from mobile devices, Adobe said.\n\nAdobe Analytics data is based on more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million SKUs and 18 product categories, according to the company. More than 200 online retailers in the Top 2000 use Adobe Analytics for their web analytics, and more than 100 use it for site design and development. Top 2000 online retailers also use it for content delivery and management, as an ecommerce platform, a marketing platform, for personalization and more.\n\nAdobe also said consumers embraced generative AI during Amazon Prime Day 2025. They used generative AI chat services and browsers for shopping assistance. Adobe added that generative AI traffic to U.S. retail sites, which it measured by shoppers clicking on a link, increased 3,300% year over year.\n\n“And while AI-driven traffic remains modest compared to other channels (paid search, email), the growth shows the impact of AI on shoppers looking for deals or specific product details,” Adobe said.\n\nOnline holiday sales in 2024 'most mobile of all time'\n\n“Hot sellers” during the Prime Day event, Adobe said, included products such as:\n\nThose hot sellers benefited from strong discounts in particular categories. Apparel peaked at 24% off listed price, which compares to 20% in 2024. Meanwhile, Adobe also noted high discounts in:\n\n37% of consumers spent up to $20, on average, on their Amazon orders, Numerator data showed. Meanwhile, 29% spent at least $100, on average.\n\n46% of households spent an average of at least $200 during Prime Day, according to Numerator data. And while more than a third of households (37%) placed one order, more than a fifth placed two (23%). 14% placed three orders, and 9% placed four. Nearly a fifth (18%) placed five orders during the period.\n\nBased on the number of units consumers purchased, Numerator found that the top-selling items on Amazon during Prime Day 2025 were:\n\nIt also found that two-thirds (67%) of items sold for less than $20, while 3% were more than $100. The average spend per item, Numerator said, was $24.59.\n\nBy category, Numerator said, consumers spent most on:\n\nSubmit your data and we’ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.",
